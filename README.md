# Power-BI-Dashboard

Project Title:
HR Analytics Dashboard for Workforce and Attrition Insights

Short Description:
This project provides an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze employee demographics, attrition trends, job satisfaction, and workforce distribution. The dashboard helps HR teams identify areas of concern, improve employee retention strategies, and optimize workforce planning.

Business Problem:
High employee attrition leads to increased hiring costs, loss of skilled talent, and disruptions in productivity. HR leaders need actionable insights into workforce demographics, attrition drivers, and employee satisfaction to reduce turnover and enhance employee engagement.

Goal of the Dashboard:
1. To monitor workforce distribution across departments, age groups, and education fields.
2. To identify patterns and key drivers of attrition.
3. To measure job satisfaction across roles.
4. To provide actionable insights for strategic HR decision-making.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
1. Overall Metrics (Top Cards): Displays headcount, attrition rate, attrition count, active employees, and average age.
2. Department-wise Attrition (Pie Chart): Highlights that Sales has the highest attrition (56%), followed by R&D (39%).
3. Employee by Age Group (Bar Chart): Shows majority workforce is aged 25–34 and 35–44.
4. Educational Field-wise Attrition (Bar Chart): Life Sciences and Medical fields contribute most to attrition.
5. Job Satisfaction by Role (Heatmap Table): Shows satisfaction distribution across job roles, identifying high and low satisfaction areas.
6. Attrition by Gender & Age Group (Donut Charts): Reveals highest attrition rates in employees aged 55+ (72.7%).

Business Impact:
1. Provides data-driven insights into attrition patterns, helping HR take proactive measures.
2. Identifies high-risk departments and age groups, enabling targeted retention strategies.
3. Highlights job roles with low satisfaction, supporting HR in improving employee engagement.
4. Supports strategic workforce planning and reduces cost of turnover.

Key Insights:
1. Sales department faces the highest attrition (56%), demanding urgent retention strategies.
2. Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds show the highest educational attrition.
3. Workforce is concentrated in 25–44 age group, but attrition is critical among employees over 55 (72.7%).
4. Sales Executives, Research Scientists, and Lab Technicians are critical roles with significant headcount, requiring focused engagement initiatives.
5. Job satisfaction scores are mixed; targeted improvements in roles with low satisfaction can help reduce attrition.
